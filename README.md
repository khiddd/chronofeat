## 📋 Overview

chronofeat is a powerful tool for time-based feature engineering in R. It helps you prepare your data for forecasting tasks by providing a straightforward, formula-based interface. This means you can easily create lags, moving averages, rolling statistics, and even calendar features. The tool is flexible and works with different models, allowing for recursive multi-step predictions. Whether you are analyzing time-series data, econometrics, or machine learning tasks, chronofeat can assist you in enhancing your modeling experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started
